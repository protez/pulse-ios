                Welcome to the website for the <strong>unofficial</strong> iPhone and iPad
                client for Neudesic Pulse. The goal of this website is to document the
                design and construction of the Pulse client application and to provide
                end-user documentation and helpful tips and tricks for interacting with
                Neudesic Pulse and the Pulse client.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that this is an <strong>unofficial</strong> project. It's a
                hobby project that has three primary goals:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Learn how to program against the Pulse API</li>
                <li>Experiment with ideas for developing iOS applications around Pulse</li>
                <li>Serve as an example to other Pusle users to demonstrate how the Pulse API can be used to integrate with Pulse</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                As a Neudesic employee, Pulse is a product that I use very frequently during
                my daily activities. I use it to follow news about the company as well as to
                collaborate with customers and co-workers on projects. Pulse can help to
                facilitate communication and discussion in distributed teams much more
                effectively than email.
